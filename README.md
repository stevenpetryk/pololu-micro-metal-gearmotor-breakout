# Pololu micro metal gearmotor connector breakout board

<img src="./images/render.jpg" alt="" style="border-radius: 10px;" />

This is a breadboard-friendly breakout board specifically designed to work with the Pololu magnetic encoder pair kit connectors, specifically:

- [Magnetic Encoder Pair Kit with Side-Entry Connector for Micro Metal Gearmotors](https://www.pololu.com/product/4761)
- [Magnetic Encoder Pair Kit with Top-Entry Connector for Micro Metal Gearmotors](https://www.pololu.com/product/4760)

These two encoders are fitted with JST-SH connectors with a specific pinout. JST-SH connectors are a bit too small to solder 20 AWG wires too, so this breakout board makes it easier.

The two headers are spaced by 0.3", so it takes up minimal space on a standard breadboard, and you can let the JST connectors "hang off" the end of the breakout board.

## Pinout

- **VIN**: 2.7V to 18V DC. Both pins are connected, so you can wire up power to whichever side is more convenient.
- **GND**: Ground. Just like VIN, these two pins are connected, so you only need to ground one side.
- **ENC**: These are the "OUT A" and "OUT B" from the Pololu encoder datasheet, two for each side. These are the outputs of the quadrature encoders for each motor.
- **MOT**: These are "M1" and "M2" from the Pololu encoder datasheet, two for each side. Hook these up to the motor supply voltages. If you're using a microcontroller, I've found the DRV8833 dual motor driver works well with Pololu's micro metal gearmotors.

## Purchasing

You can [order this board on JLCPCB â†’][jlcpcb]

It's quite small, and only two layers, so it should only cost $2-$4 USD. I have some extras, so if you want, I'd happily mail one to you (unassembled), just [DM me on Twitter][twitter].

## Bill of materials

It's surprisingly hard to find horizontal JST SMD connectors from anywhere but Sparkfun, so I tend to just order parts from there to save on shipping. They have bulk discounts, so if you're doing lots of work with micro metal gearmotors, just buy a bunch.
